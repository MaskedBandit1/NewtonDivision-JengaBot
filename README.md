# NewtonDivision-JengaBot

I am a Lead Control Systems Advisor for 5th-8th grade youth wishing to learn FRC Java. Part of American Heritage/Ninjineers Robotics Summer Camp for kids 3rd-8th grade.

In Session 1 of 2016 Summer, kids had to create full-sized, FRC legal Robot that can play Jenga. This is the version the middle school aged campers created with my guidance during the session.

There were two divisions of campers that built and coded 2 different robots to play Jenga.

1) Newton

2) Einstein

I worked closely with both teams. The Newton Team, whose code is in this repo, elected to solve the challenge using a lift and a conveyor belt.
